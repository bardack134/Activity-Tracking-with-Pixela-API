**Description:** This project uses the Pixela API to record and track the amount of time spent on a specific activity each day (in our case, we track the number of hours spent studying Japanese daily). The code allows you to create a user in Pixela, set up a graph for tracking, and add, update, or delete data of the activity performed each day.

**Tools used:**

**Requests:** Python library used to make HTTP requests to the Pixela API.

**Datetime:** Python module used to work with dates and times, necessary to record the date of each activity entry.

**Api:** Pixela Api, it's a web service for tracking daily activities. It visualizes your data in a calendar heat map, similar to GitHubâ€™s contribution graph. (https://docs.pixe.la/entry/post-user)
