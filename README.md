# Activity-Tracking-with-Pixela-API
This project uses the Pixela API to record and track the amount of time spent on a specific activity each day (in our case, we track the number of hours spent studying Japanese daily). The code allows you to create a user in Pixela, set up a graph for tracking, and add, update, or delete data of the activity performed each day.
